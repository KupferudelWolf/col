# Discord Bots
This repository includes my personal discord bot projects. While some are catered to specific needs and maybe ultimately useless to anybody else, I don't mind if anybody uses these for themselves, provided they do not claim the scripts as their own.

## col: Color Scheme Bot
A custom Discord.js bot for handling colors and swatches.

### Current features:
* Creates a swatch from input colors (by hexadecimal value or by name).
* Randomly generates colors.
* Creates a color gradient from input colors.

### Upcoming features:
* Randomly generate color scheme swatches.
* Create dynamic compositions with input colors.

## bvb: Birds VS Bees
This is one of those aforementioned useless-to-everybody-but-me bots. Specifically, it is a text-based adventure MMORPG to be played within the Discord client, in which players choose a side in The Great War of Birds and Bees and gather resources to take over the opponent's bases and cities. It's really just an inside joke that's gone too far.

## iasid: It's Always Sunny Title Card Generator
A custom Discord.js bot for generating title cards inspired by the show *It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia*.

### Current features:
* Creates a title card of up to four lines of input text.

### Upcoming fixes:
* Numbers! Because they don't work, and I don't know why, and no, it's not that JS isn't reading them as a string, shut up.
* Maybe the text will actually be centered, idk, that depends on if the library I'm using will update soon.
